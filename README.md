# HOSVD
Python implementation of the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (Tensor SVD)

Use the HOSVD.py file to find classes for performing the SVD and HOSVD. This code follows the work published in De Lathauwer, Lieven, Bart De Moor, and Joos Vandewalle. "A multilinear singular value decomposition." SIAM journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications 21.4 (2000): 1253-1278.
